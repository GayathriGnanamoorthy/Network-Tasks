### 7. Risks of Malicious Extensions

> Malicious browser extensions can steal sensitive data like passwords, credit card details, and typed messages by silently monitoring user input. They often track browsing history and online activity, selling the data to advertisers or attackers. Some inject ads or redirect users to phishing sites to steal credentials. Advanced malicious extensions can even act as malware droppers, installing spyware or creating backdoors. To stay safe, users should only install extensions from trusted sources, regularly audit permissions, and remove any unused or suspicious tools.
