# Password Strength Evaluation 

## 1. Create Password Samples
- Created multiple passwords with varying complexity:
  - Example 1: `hello123` (simple)
  - Example 2: `Hello@123` (moderate)
  - Example 3: `H3ll0@W0rld2025!` (strong)

## 2. Include Character Variety
- Used combinations of:
  - **Uppercase letters**
  - **Lowercase letters**
  - **Numbers**
  - **Special characters** (e.g., @, #, !)
  - **Different lengths** (8 to 20+ characters)

## 3. Test with Online Password Strength Checker
- Tool used: [https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/](https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/)
- Each password was tested and rated with estimated crack time.

## 4. Note Feedback & Scores
- Weak passwords : `hello123`

- Moderate one :  'Hello@123'

- Stronger ones : `H3ll0@W0rld2025!`

## 5. Best Practices Identified
- A password should be at least 12 characters long (ideally 16 characters or more); our password-related research has found that 45 percent of Americans use passwords of eight characters or less, which are not as secure as longer passwords.
- A password shouldn’t contain any consecutive letters or numbers (i.e. ABCD, 1234, etc.)
-  A password shouldn’t be the word “password” or the same letter or number repeated.
- A password should include a combination of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and characters.
## 6. Tips Learned from Evaluation
- Substituting letters with numbers (e.g., `E` → `3`) improves strength slightly but isn’t foolproof.
- Passphrases are better than short complex passwords.
- Avoid personal info like names, birthdates, or usernames.

## 7. Common Password Attack Methods
- **Brute Force Attack:** Tries all possible combinations.
- **Dictionary Attack:** Uses lists of common passwords/phrases.
- **Credential Stuffing:** Uses stolen credentials from previous breaches.
- **Social Engineering:** Tricks users into revealing passwords.

## 8. Summary: Password Complexity vs. Security
- Higher complexity directly increases the time and resources needed to crack passwords.
- Simple passwords can be broken in seconds using automated tools.
- Strong, unique, and lengthy passwords offer significant protection against brute-force and dictionary attacks.
